# .VIMRC

This is the vim configuration I'm using: zero plugin (except for auto closing
brackets, I used delimitMate.vim - less buggy than auto-pairs.vim) GORGEOUS
native color theme and has been tweaked specifically for GUI to support
true-color syntax highlighting.

Please rename the vim directory to .vim, custom.vimrc to .vimrc and put them
in your user root directory (~).

## Enjoy!
